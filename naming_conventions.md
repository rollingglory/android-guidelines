# Naming Conventions
Internal conventions for file names, class names, and variable names in the project
  
### 1. File Naming
  
#### 1.2 Drawable files
Drawable files are named with the following format `<asset_type>_<description>`. The description should describe the image itself, by its name, characteristic, or its group/classification. If the description contains more than one word separate each word with underscore.
